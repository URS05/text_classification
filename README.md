# 🧠 Text Classification with Logistic Regression

This project is part of my capstone assignment for the Artificial Intelligence track at Coincent. The primary goal of this project is to perform binary sentiment classification (positive or negative) on product titles derived from a large dataset focusing on Toys & Games.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source:** The dataset is obtained from Amazon product data, formatted in `.parquet`.
- **Size:** Approximately 890,000 product records.
- **Fields Utilized:** `title` and `average_rating`.

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to build a classification model that predicts sentiment based on review-based ratings:
- Ratings of 4.0 or higher are classified as positive sentiment.
- Ratings of 2.0 or lower are classified as negative sentiment.

Neutral ratings are excluded to maintain a binary classification.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.10+
- **Libraries:** pandas and scikit-learn
- **Tools:** Regular Expressions for text preprocessing
- **Model:** Logistic Regression

## 🚀 Project Workflow

1. Load and concatenate multiple `.parquet` files into a single dataset.
2. Assign labels (`positive` or `negative`) based on the average ratings.
3. Preprocess the product titles by converting all text to lowercase and removing punctuation and digits.
4. Use `CountVectorizer` for text vectorization, including the removal of English stopwords.
5. Split the data into training and testing sets using an 80/20 ratio.
6. Fit the `LogisticRegression` model with class balancing to ensure fairness in prediction.
7. Evaluate the model's performance using the following metrics:
   - Accuracy
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report

## 📈 Results

- **Model Accuracy:** Approximately 84.4%
- The model demonstrates strong precision and recall metrics for the positive sentiment class.
- Detailed confusion matrix and performance metrics can be found in the output generated by `load_toys_data.py`.
